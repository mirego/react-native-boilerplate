## Introduction

To learn more about why we created and maintain this boilerplate project, read our [blog post](https://shift.mirego.com/en/boilerplate-projects).

## Usage

### Package Manager

Make sure that `yarn` is correctly configured before using the boilerplate. Otherwise, you might encounter some packaging errors when using other tools like `npm`.

This also means that every command you would usually run with `npm` needs to be run with `yarn` instead.

eg. `yarn foo bar` instead of `npm foo bar`

### Initialization

Initialize your project with the template

```
npx react-native@latest init YourProjectName --template @mirego/react-native-boilerplate
```
