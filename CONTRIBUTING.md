# How to contribute

## A word about the project

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

This project is our vision of a well set up project and is the base we use to create all of our React Native applications at Mirego. We decided to make it public so that others can benefit from our experience and the lessons learned over the years of building several projects with different objectives; all fulfilled by this boilerplate.

While we accept pull requests and suggestions, it is more of a project that we want to share so that you can build awesome things with it and maybe, base your own boilerplate off of it!

## Contributing

We strongly suggest you open an issue before starting to work on code that you would like to see in this project. This will prevent you, for example, from implementing a feature that we, Mirego, already discussed and decided not to use.

Bug and typo fixes are always welcomed, of course üôÇ

Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
